[Node.js link](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Please always choose the LTS version.

### Creating and running our first React app

Please create a folder on your local machine which we will use through out the course. A recommendation is to create a folder called "projects" on your main drive, and inside it we will clone our match-labs app.
Example: D:/projects

1. Open a terminal window. On Windows, search for CMD.

2. Navigate in the terminal to the projects folder by running the following command:
   `cd D:\projects` where `D:` is your folder drive

3. Once inside the folder clone our repository by running:
   `git clone https://github.com/PaulMacinic/match-labs-course.git`

4. Navigate to the folder you cloned by using:
   `cd match-labs-course`

5. Once inside the folder run the following command:
   `npm install`
   
6. Once the modules finish installing you can start the project by running:
   `npm start`

7. Open the match-labs-course folder in VSCode

8. Navigate in your favourite browser to localhost:3000

8. Enjoy, you just cloned your first React app. ðŸŽ‰
